# Coffeeshop

#[Coffee 101](https://coffee101partdeux.herokuapp.com/)

#### High Hopes:
>Recent exposure to higher end coffee and appriciation of it, history from my schooling of coffee economics regarding its impact on the earth, and overall caffeine junkie i thought this would be a great time to show things ive learned myself and maybe get someone into diving deeper into the culture and science of coffee brewing. I wanted to really flesh out a sweet store to buy different coffee grind from various companies ive had experience with besides the commerical coffee...all coffee is commerical but not SBX, Peets, Philz. Pages showing off equipment and various techniques to use them. The biggest one was to have a searchable google map with a custom search filtering out the companies mentioned before to find a local coffee shop in your area since we are all over the United States.

#### Tech Used

  -CSS - Bootstrap  
  -MVC Structure  
  -Node.js  
  -Mongoose  
  -MognoDB  
  -Express  
  -EJS, EJS Partials  


#### Approach Taken
>After wireframing everything out and having a solid plan i felt before starting i began fleshing out the routes and all the files i would need for the project. Moving through everything I began have a pretty good structure that was semi functional for two days...your controllers go after your middlewear if you want them to be available. Yeah. figured out i swapped the position after looking at the video again and seeing that things were written out of order and it worked. Having functionality to 75% I was able to start getting creative in the design and overall feel of the pages. overall the website came out to pretty close to what originally was drawn in the wireframes surprisingly. 

#### Challenges
>Controller misplacement
>Original plan incorporating a sign in but realizing it wasnt nessesary for this build round my routes and links needed to be all reworked to make it easier for post and delete routes as i couldnt get them to work with the previous routes.
>Google maps api is very easy to work. Lots of pre done samples to make it easy to get started.While getting a map was easy i could not for the life of me sift through the documents or find how to do it in a google search....hey remember the api key story we were told...i did that and got 3 emails from google and git hub within like 2 mins of upload...dev screen overlay now since i didnt want to risk it. HAHAHA. i disabled the keys right after

#### Wireframing
See above

#### Future goals
>Get the image to get yploaded, used the phrase get details for my seeded info since i have img clickable not the name. Get the google maps search to work since i think that will be the cherry on the top for it. 
Get the store part of it to function with a sign in and cart to make it be full service not just informational
